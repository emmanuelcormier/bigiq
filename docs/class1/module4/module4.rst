Module 4: BIG-IQ License Management
===================================

In this module, we will learn how to manage BIG-IP licenses from BIG-IQ.

BIG-IQ can manage licenses for up to 5000 BIG-IP VEs.

There are 3 ways that BIG-IQ can give a license to a BIG-IP:

- Managed devices: If a device is already managed by BIG-IQ, you can select the device from a list
- Unmanaged devices: If you donâ€™t want to manage the device with BIG-IQ, you just want to give it a license, you can specify IP, port, username, and password to push a license to a device
- Disconnected Devices: [NEW from 5.4] For situations where the BIG-IQ cannot talk directly to the BIG-IP, you can provide device MAC address and hypervisor information to BIG-IQ via the API and BIG-IQ will return a license that can be copied on to the box via some intermediary orchestrator

BIG-IQ can handle various types of pool licenses, including subscription and ELA pools, as well as allowing the customer to create their own pool of licenses out of individual VE keys.
