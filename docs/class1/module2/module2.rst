Module 2: Importing BIG-IP devices for Management and Inventory
===============================================================

In this module, we will learn how to import BIG-IP devices in BIG-IQ.

The first step of managing devices with BIG-IQ is device discovery. The basic discovery allows for device inventory, device health monitoring, backup and restore of the managed device, integration with F5â€™s iHealth service, software upgrade, and device template deployment. As part of the discovery process, you can choose to manage other parts of the BIG-IP configuration.

In this scenario, we will import a standalone BIG-IP device, review the device information available in BIG-IQ, export our inventory to a CSV file, and review that.

Adding devices to BIG-IQ inventory:

**Dependencies**

1. The BIG-IP device must be located in your network,
2. The BIG-IP device must be running a compatible version
